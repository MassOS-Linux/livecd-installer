This is the Bootable Live CD for MassOS.

If you have just downloaded the ISO file on Windows and are reading this, you
have probably mounted the image with Windows Explorer. You must write the ISO
file to a USB flash drive to be able to boot the MassOS live environment.

A guide on how to do that can be found at the following link:

  https://github.com/MassOS-Linux/MassOS/blob/main/installation-guide.md

We hope that you enjoy using MassOS.
